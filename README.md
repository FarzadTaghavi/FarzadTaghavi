## Hi there, I'm Farzad ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a curious and driven individual with a focus on software engineering, specializing in full-stack using Node.js, TypeScript, and React. I enjoy building things that solve real problems, especially when it involves AI or trading systems.

Before moving into engineering, I spent over 10 years in performance marketing and SEO. That experience shaped how I think about users, products, and outcomes. It gave me a deep understanding of what drives value and a data driven mindset that I bring into everything I build.

In recent years, Iâ€™ve worked across frontend, backend, infrastructure, and AI projects. Iâ€™ve mostly worked independently or in small teams, where Iâ€™ve taken ownership of everything from architecture to delivery. Iâ€™ve also built and continue to maintain automated trading systems that generate consistent returns using real time data and multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.

People Iâ€™ve worked with describe me as reliable, thoughtful, and proactive. Iâ€™m known for bringing structure to complex challenges, improving workflows, and communicating clearly across both technical and non technical contexts.

Above all, I care about working on things that matter, with people who care. Iâ€™m always learning and always building. Right now, Iâ€™m looking for opportunities involving AI, trading systems, or anything that combines software, data, and real world impact.
